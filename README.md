# Pripol

> Privacy policy coverage analyis using deep neural networks

Pripol allows users to perform a coverage anaylsis of a website's privacy policy through a simple web interface. Pripol employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the most likely corresponding data practices for a given segment/section of the given policy. The annotation scheme and dataset is based off of the [OPP-115 Corpus](https://usableprivacy.org/static/files/swilson_acl_2016.pdf).

This repository contains the code for my related undergraduate research thesis: A Comparative Study of Sequence Classification Models for Privacy Policy Coverage Analysis. The academic paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04972).
